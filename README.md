## Projects

### Student Screen Time Insights Dashboard

[Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYzc2YjYxNWQtNTRkOC00MTQ3LTg2ZWYtYmY4MGQyZjE5NjlhIiwidCI6IjkzNzI1ZGI0LTFiZjEtNGZiYi05NGFmLWFkNmMwMjUxYTAxOCJ9&pageName=0164315c22d8b9d981e7)

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize survey data on student screen time. The project involved cleaning and structuring raw responses, building dynamic reports, and designing clear visualizations to uncover behavioral trends. The dashboard highlights patterns in device usage, time distribution, and correlations with productivity, providing actionable insights for stakeholders to improve student well-being and engagement.

### Master’s Dissertation - AI-Powered Workflow Optimization with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

[View Project on GitHub](Link)

Developed a prototype AI system to detect and optimize inefficiencies in organizational workflows. Due to the lack of labeled process data and the high expertise required for manual labeling, I applied a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance large language model outputs with a curated knowledge base. The system, built and deployed using AWS (Bedrock, S3), delivers evidence-based recommendations, bottleneck detection, and visual workflow comparisons. Validated on real-world travel and accommodation workflows, the project demonstrates how AI can provide scalable, practical business process optimization solutions.
